# refugees cologne

Programming/startup communities in Germany have started awesome initiatives like http://refugeesonrails.org/ or http://refugeehackathon.de/.  We are a group of people that want to organize something here in Cologne.

This repository is supposed to be a tool to organize ourselves and to figure out what we can do to help.

What can you do here?

* Add yourself to the list of potential organizers/helpers in the [wiki](https://github.com/colognerb/refugees/wiki/List-of-potential-organizers-and-helpers)
